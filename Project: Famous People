--- Who they're married too? I used a self Join and added aliases "a" "b"---
SELECT a.name, b.name FROM marriage
JOIN famous_people a
ON marriage.person1_id = a.id --connects the 1st person in each marraige to their name
JOIN famous_people b
ON marriage.person2_id = b.id; -- connects the 2nd person in each marriage to their name

--- What movies are they in? Using the same concept as above but since we have 2 different named attributes I didn't need to use aliases---
