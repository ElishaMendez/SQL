## Project: Design a store database
- For this project, using SQL I created a Pharmacy Inventory Database with Summary Statistic. The goal was to practice creating tables, 
inserting real-world medication data, and running queries that organize and summarize inventory information. This helped me apply what
I learned in a practical way and build a basic system that could track stock levels, pricing, and product availability.

## Technologies
- SQL

## Features
- A pharmacy inventory table with five columns: ID, drug name, quantity, package size, and price.
- 15 medication entries representing different strengths and stock levels.
- Ability to sort products by price to quickly identify the most affordable or expensive items.
- A statistical query using SUM() to calculate total quantities and group similar medications.

## What I learned
- I learned how to structure a functional SQL table and load it with real-world pharmacy data. I also practiced grouping and summarizing data using aggregate functions. More importantly, I learned how ordering and filtering can turn a simple dataset into something that actually supports decision-making in an operational environment.

## How it can be Improved
Add another column for last_date_purchased and auto increment the ID

Khan academy - Project: Design a store database
Create your own store! Your store should sell one type of things, like clothing or bikes, whatever you want your store to specialize in. 
You should have a table for all the items in your store, and at least 5 columns for the kind of data you think you'd need to store. 
You should sell at least 15 items, and use select statements to order your items by price and show at least one statistic about the items.


SQL code:
/*
Pharmacy store
-make a table
-5 columns for the kind of data
-15 items in your store
-order them price, and show one statistic
*/

CREATE Table mendezPharmacy (
id INTEGER Primary key, 
name TEXT, 
Quantity INTEGER, 
Package_Size INTEGER, 
Price_in_dollars INTEGER);

INSERT INTO mendezPharmacy VALUES (1, "Atorvastatin 5mg", 1, 30, 4 );
INSERT INTO mendezPharmacy VALUES (2, "Atorvastatin 5mg", 3, 60, 8);
INSERT INTO mendezPharmacy VALUES (3, "Atorvastatin 5mg", 5, 90, 10);
INSERT INTO mendezPharmacy VALUES (4, "Atorvastatin 10mg", 9, 30, 4);
INSERT INTO mendezPharmacy VALUES (5, "Atorvastatin 10mg", 2, 60, 8);
INSERT INTO mendezPharmacy VALUES (6, "Atorvastatin 10mg", 8, 90, 10);
INSERT INTO mendezPharmacy VALUES (7, "Ibuprofen 800mg", 5, 90, 6);
INSERT INTO mendezPharmacy VALUES (8, "Lisinopril 10mg", 0, 100, 5);
INSERT INTO mendezPharmacy VALUES (9, "Lisinopril 100mg", 0, 90, 5);

INSERT INTO mendezPharmacy VALUES (12, "Ceterizine 10mg", 20, 90, 1);
INSERT INTO mendezPharmacy VALUES (13, "Gabapentin 300mg", 2, 100, 15);
INSERT INTO mendezPharmacy VALUES (14, "Cyclobenzaprine 10mg", 6, 500, 20);
INSERT INTO mendezPharmacy VALUES (15, "Metformin 1000mg", 11, 100, 2);


SELECT name, Price_in_dollars, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity FROM mendezPharmacy ORDER BY Price_in_dollars;
